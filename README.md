# Music-Final-Project
This is my final for my Applied Statistics course where I analyzed 200 best songs of the 2010s and look to see if the year the song came out affects the number of streams a song gets.
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "final_project.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the data set, open "FINAL PROJECT - data.csv" file.

## **Data**
The data collected for this analysis was the 200 best songs of the 2010s. The question being asked is does the year the song is made affect the number of streams the song gets. Each unit of analysis is one song and there are 200 observations. 

I gather the data by taking account each song's year it came out and finding how many streams the song has.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of streams was operationalized through a quantitative variable counting the total number of streams a song has received on Spotify, ranging from 30,381 to 2,592,850,634.

The concept of year at release was operationalized by researching the year the song was made and creating a quantitative variable that ranged from 2008 to 2019.
